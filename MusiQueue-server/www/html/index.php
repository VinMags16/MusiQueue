		<h1>MusiQueue</h1>
		<p>MusiQueue is an interactive application that allows you to share and update music in real time with your friends and family. MusiQueue can be access from online or on your mobile android device anytime and anywhere. To start, a user creates a hub. Hubs are a hosting spot that you can join to collaboratively search and play your own music. Users can find existing hubs by searching the hub's name, by searching hubs near your GPS location or by searching hubs within your current Wi-Fi network. Once you have joined a hub, you are free to search and add songs to the queue. The queue displays songs in order based on when they were added and allows you to upvote or downvote the songs in order to move them up or down in the queue. MusiQueue is your virtual jukebox where your friends and family can come together to collaboratively choose and play your own music.</p>
		<p>Coming soon to Google Play!</p>
