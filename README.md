# MusiQueue

MusiQueue is an Android application that allows a group of users to crowd source a playlist.  One user can create a "hub" for others to connect to, and the other users can search for the hub and connect (with the correct password).  Once in the hub users can submit their own song requests by searching via YouTube in the application itself.  The chosen video will be entered in to the queue and other users will be allowed to vote on the video to move it up or down in the queue.

## Deployment

The app is not currently deployed, but if/when it is it will be in the Google Play Store.
